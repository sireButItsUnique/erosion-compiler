# erosion-compiler
Erosion compiler for the corrosion language.
Should feature full compilation into assembly from .cor files upon completition (our deadline we've set is by the end of June 2023 hopefully), and will be packaged along with sedimentation for a g++ like cli tool. After completion, a debugger for the language in the form of impolosion-debug will be implemented fully in corrosion as both a proof of concept and a stress test for erosion. For more info on corrosion, the language the compiler is built for, visit the official repo [corrosion-lang](https://github.com/pepeworm/corrosion-lang).
